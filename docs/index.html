			<p>Signe Elvira Elgh was born into a family that managed Loka Brunn. She later became a hairdresser and had her own hair salon. Ever the forward-thinking woman she had a child and raised him alone, self-archived for posterity because she knew her life and experiences as an unmarried woman mattered, keeping photo memories of her life experiences and loved ones; and recording an oral herstory before her death hoping that it would share her life and times with her two grandsons.  </p>

			<h3>Self-Archiving & The Independent Woman</h3>
			<p>This project was a long and arduous decision-making process. It began in 2021 with the acquisition of the photo books here in the US (sent from Sweden) as well as cassette tapes. Initially, my aim was to make Elvira’s oral herstory available, but the DCHM course did not have an instructor specializing in audio recordings and I was discouraged from doing this. I had originally digitized the tapes in 2017 while in Sweden, using a tape player and audio cable into the desktop PC. The quality of the digitization was not great. The tapes were also quite fragile. As a result, the digitization was very noisy and the voice volume was very low, and I needed to process the digitized audio files through noise reduction filters. </p>
			<p>Elvira’s grandson and I then attempted to painstakingly translate what she was saying into English but found it difficult. I then created a TEI transcription of a printed poem called “Minnen av Loka Brunn” that I would then pair with an album of photos from Loka Brunn, and a few of the paraphrased translations from the audio tapes. However, the project seemed both too extensive and not cohesive enough. Over a year later, I chose the Kamrater album as a discrete and cohesive unit that I felt would help me neatly fulfill the steps of a digitization project while being easily critically analyzable. </p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
			<p>The aim is to digitally preserve through digital scanning; to create rich metadata for the photographs; to create machine-readable metadata; to make the digitizations and metadata findable and accessible to machines and humans; to present the digital reproductions and metadata in a critical, interpretive, and aesthetically thoughtful way for human perusal.</p>
			<p>The purpose of the project is to digitally preserve and present the photo albums of Signe Elvira Elgh b. 1900 in Molkom, Sweden; to provide the communities of Molkom, Loka, Grythyttan, Kristinehamn with an archival record of its inhabitants from the early 1900’s; to preserve the visual history of these communities; and to demonstrate critical and interpretive digitization best practices.</p>

			<h3>Source Material</h3>
			<p>Vira, as Elvira was affectionately known, had several photo albums and a collection of photos. This particular album is one of Elvira Elgh’s schoolmates (and occasional friend and relative) from Kristinehamns Praktiska-skola from 1917-1918. The album is [description here]</p>
			<p> this album was given to Per Ingemar Elgh upon his mother Signe Elvira Elgh’s death in 1988. Per Elgh kept them until his death in 2014. They were then passed to his son Per Mathias Elgh and his then-wife Nicc Elgh in 2015. Nicc initially requested the photos while searching for photos to create Per Ingemar Elgh’s funeral program</p>

			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>This project has relevance to the reparative LIS community; the LGBTQ for work that has been done by non-binary archivist and lesbians, and for its representation-is-not-gender approach to photo description; to the feminist community for representation of a single mother self-archiving; to the local Swedish community and historical societies; to genealogists and family historians; to the Swedish photography community and critical photo metadata community.</p>
